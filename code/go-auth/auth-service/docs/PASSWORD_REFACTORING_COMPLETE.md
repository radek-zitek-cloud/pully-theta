# Password Package Refactoring - COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully completed the consolidation of all password-related operations into a dedicated `internal/password/` package as specified in the refactoring plan. This refactoring improves code organization, maintainability, and follows best practices for Go project structure.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Package Structure Created
- **`internal/password/doc.go`** - Package-level documentation
- **`internal/password/service.go`** - Main password service with business logic
- **`internal/password/handler.go`** - HTTP handlers for password endpoints
- **`internal/password/validator.go`** - Password strength validation logic
- **`internal/password/reset.go`** - Password reset service with secure tokens

### 2. Core Functionality Implemented

#### Password Validation (`validator.go`)
- Configurable password strength requirements
- Character class validation (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars)
- Length validation (min/max)
- Common password detection
- Password strength scoring (0-100)
- Performance-optimized validation rules
- Comprehensive error messages with suggestions

#### Password Reset Service (`reset.go`)
- Cryptographically secure token generation (32 bytes = 256 bits)
- SHA-256 token hashing for secure storage
- Time-limited tokens with configurable expiry (default: 24 hours)
- Rate limiting (5 attempts per IP, 3 per email)
- Single-use tokens with automatic invalidation
- Email integration for reset notifications
- Comprehensive audit logging

#### Password Service (`service.go`)
- Password change operations with current password verification
- Bcrypt hashing with configurable cost (default: 12)
- Integration with validator and reset services
- Refresh token revocation on password change
- Dependency injection pattern
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### HTTP Handlers (`handler.go`)
- RESTful API endpoints using Gin framework
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- JWT authentication for protected endpoints
- Rate limiting middleware integration
- Structured logging for all operations

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Protected Endpoints (Require Authentication)
- **`PUT /api/v1/auth/password/change`** - Change user password
  - Requires current password verification
  - Validates new password strength
  - Revokes all refresh tokens on success

#### Public Endpoints
- **`POST /api/v1/auth/password/forgot`** - Request password reset
  - Sends secure reset email with token
  - Rate limited to prevent abuse
  - Works with any email (no user enumeration)

- **`POST /api/v1/auth/password/reset`** - Complete password reset
  - Validates reset token and sets new password
  - Single-use tokens with expiration
  - Comprehensive audit logging

### 4. Integration Completed

#### Main Application Integration
- Updated `cmd/server/main.go` to initialize password service and handler
- Configured password service with secure defaults:
  - Minimum 12 character passwords
  - All character classes required
  - 32-byte reset tokens
  - 24-hour token expiry
  - Bcrypt cost factor of 12
  - Token revocation on password change

#### Router Integration
- Updated HTTP router to use new password handler
- Replaced old auth handler password methods
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API paths
- Proper middleware integration (authentication, rate limiting, CORS)

### 5. Code Quality & Security

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive docstrings for all public functions and types
- Package-level documentation explaining architecture and usage
- Inline comments for complex business logic
- Security considerations documented throughout
- Performance complexity analysis included

#### Security Features
- Cryptographically secure random token generation
- Secure token hashing (SHA-256) for storage
- Time-limited tokens to prevent replay attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Current password verification for changes
- Audit logging for all security events
- Input sanitization and validation
- No information disclosure in error messages

#### Error Handling
- Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error logging with context
- Graceful degradation for email service failures
- Proper error propagation throughout the call stack
- Security-conscious error messages to users

### 6. Cleanup Completed
- **Removed old files:**
  - `internal/service/auth_service_password.go`
  - `internal/api/auth_handler_password.go`
- **Created backup:** Files backed up to `backup-old-password-files/`
- **Updated imports:** All references updated to use new package
