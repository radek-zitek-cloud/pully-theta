  - Registration success/failure rates
  - Login attempt patterns
  - Token refresh patterns
  - Password reset usage

#### Distributed Tracing
- [ ] **Request Tracing**
  - Add distributed tracing support
  - Request correlation IDs
  - Performance monitoring

### üöÄ Deployment Improvements

#### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Enhanced Configuration Validation**
  - Structured validation with detailed error messages
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Configuration hot-reloading

#### Health Checks
- [ ] **Comprehensive Health Checks**
  - Database connectivity
  - Redis connectivity  
  - Email service health
  - Dependency health monitoring
